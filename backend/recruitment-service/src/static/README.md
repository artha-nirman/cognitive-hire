# Static Files Directory

This directory contains static files used by the FastAPI application, such as:

- OAuth redirect pages for Swagger UI authentication
- Static assets for UI components
- Other static resources that need to be served directly

The directory is automatically mounted by the FastAPI app at the `/static` URL path.
