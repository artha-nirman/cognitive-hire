# High-Level Design

## 1. Introduction

The diagram presents a comprehensive architecture for a modern recruitment management system. This paper analyzes the architectural components, their relationships, and the system's overall organization. The architecture follows a modular approach, dividing the recruitment workflow into distinct functional areas while maintaining integration across the entire candidate journey.

## 2. System Overview

The architecture represents a full-stack recruitment platform with components spanning from authentication through the entire recruitment lifecycle. The system appears to be designed as a modular, service-oriented architecture with clearly defined functional boundaries. The layout suggests a thoughtful approach to recruitment workflows, with components organized by their role in the candidate acquisition and assessment process.

## 3. Core Architectural Components

### 3.1 Security Layer
The system implements a robust security model with two distinct components:

**Authentication:**
- Social Login integration for simplified user access
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security
- Policies framework for authentication rules management

**Authorization:**
- Role-based access control system
- Plan-based feature availability, suggesting a tiered service model

### 3.2 User & Organization Management

The **Registration** module handles both organizational and individual user onboarding, establishing the foundation for system access and utilization.

### 3.3 Financial Components

The **Payments** module includes integrations with:
- Stripe for payment processing
- PayPal as an alternative payment option

This suggests a flexible approach to financial transactions, likely supporting subscription models and possibly one-time services.

### 3.4 Operational Monitoring

The **Activity Logging** section includes:
- Organization-level logging
- User-level logging
- AI-powered monitoring

This framework provides comprehensive audit trails and potentially enables data-driven insights through AI analysis.

### 3.5 Recruitment Workflow Components

The architecture defines a systematic recruitment process through sequential modules:

1. **Workflow** management with:
   - Approval workflows
   - Pipeline tracking

2. **Sourcing** candidates through multiple channels:
   - Internal database ("Own")
   - Platform-specific sources
   - Internet-wide searching
   - LinkedIn integration

3. **Screening** capabilities using:
   - Keyword-based filtering
   - Semantic analysis
   - Hybrid approaches combining both methodologies

4. **Shortlisting** candidates through:
   - Interest Check phase (via Email, SMS, Call, LinkedIn)
   - Assessment phase (via Email, Call)

5. **Publishing** job opportunities across:
   - Platform-internal listings
   - Website integration
   - LinkedIn distribution
   - Email campaigns

6. **Scheduling** interviews using:
   - Calendar integration
   - SMS notifications
   - Call scheduling

### 3.6 Notification Framework

The system includes a robust **Notifications** system with:
- Workflow-based triggers (WFL)
- Event-based notifications
- Multiple communication mechanisms (Email, SMS, WhatsApp)

### 3.7 Analytics & Reporting

The **Dashboards & Reports** section provides:
- Workflow-level reporting (WFL)
- Event-based analytics
- Likely KPIs and metrics relevant to recruitment processes

## 4. Architectural Patterns & Principles

Several architectural patterns can be identified:

1. **Modular Design:** Clear separation of concerns with distinct functional areas
2. **Service-Oriented Architecture:** Components appear designed as services with defined responsibilities
3. **Multi-channel Integration:** Consistent incorporation of various communication channels
4. **Workflow Automation:** Structured progression through recruitment stages

## 5. Technical Considerations

While the diagram doesn't specify implementation details, the architecture suggests:

1. **API-First Design:** Components would likely communicate through well-defined APIs
2. **Integration Framework:** Multiple external services require a robust integration approach
3. **Scalability Considerations:** The modular design allows for independent scaling of components
4. **Data Flow Management:** Complex workflows require careful data synchronization

## 6. Conclusion

The architecture presents a comprehensive approach to recruitment management, addressing the entire candidate lifecycle from sourcing through hiring. The modular design provides flexibility, while the integrated workflow ensures consistency in the recruitment process. The system balances automation through AI and workflow tools with human touchpoints through multiple communication channels.
